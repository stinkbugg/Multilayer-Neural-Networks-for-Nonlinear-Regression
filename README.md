Neural Networks for Nonlinear Regression
 
* make some modifications to the supplied neural network implementation, 
* define a function that partitions data into training, validation and test sets,
* apply it to a data set, 
* define a function that runs experiments with a variety of parameter values, 
* describe your observations of these results.
